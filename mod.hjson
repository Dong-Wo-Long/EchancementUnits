    description: "Important:\n\nThis mod does not bring anything radically new to the game, but only expands the combat functionality of existing combat units.\n\nPlease pay attention:\n\nThe mod significantly redesigns units, changes the balance and generally complicates the game. Don't forget to make a backup in case you don't like the changes that the mod itself makes.\n\nP.S. The mod is made for ALE maps"
