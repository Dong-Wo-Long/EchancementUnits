# Ground support units
unit.nova.description = [#84f491]Scouting and support.[] Used for the purpose of reconnaissance, construction or support of units by attacks at a great distance.
unit.nova.details = [accent]Description:[] The latest development in the development of optical technologies allows this type of units to see the furthest, which gives them such opportunities as reconnaissance or support with the help of accurate sniper energy weapons, and their ability to quickly change their location using the built-in engine only fixes their capabilities.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] This type of combat units, just like [#ffa665]Daggers[], is not able to shoot through mountain obstacles.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#98ffa9]Novas[] are essentially medics and at the same time deadly snipers on the battlefield, so try to get rid of them as early as possible and first of all.

unit.pulsar.details = [accent]Description:[] The electric gun [#84f491]Pulsars[] allows them to penetrate the enemy's defenses without even trying to destroy an obstacle in front of them, and their ability to generate shields for themselves and allies only makes them even more dangerous, because the longer they live, the more tenacious they become, especially considering the fact that they can always retreat with battlefields in order to restore your health for a repeat attack.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Give strong enough shields that even ordinary towers are not able to immediately break through them - it is recommended to use a different type of ammunition or a more advanced tower. Have an incredible weakness in front of plastan walls.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] Despite the fact that they are the weakest of all types of units of their level, they still remain worthy opponents for an unprotected or easy-to-defend defense, and if they are not alone, then they become even more a threat to it.

unit.quasar.description = [#84f491]Assault and support.[] Suitable for covering their allies with a shield and storming simple enemy objects, as well as the ability to build on the battlefield under the dome of a strong shield.
unit.quasar.details = [accent]Description:[] [#84f491]Quasars[] can fly and build in the same way as [#84f491]Novas[], and in addition to this, small hidden rocket launchers inside laser cannons and a shield only make them more dangerous and stronger, so «[lightgray]head-on[]» attacks are highly discouraged.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Their missiles are not capable of shooting through a mountainous landscape, but this does not apply to laser weapons, however, they have a weakness in front of plastan walls - lasers cannot break through them.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#84f491]Quasars[] are capable of punching through any obstacle with their laser guns, and if you don't have plastan walls, they can easily destroy all your protection - it is recommended to find a means of fighting against them, for example, [lightgray]Lancer[].

unit.atrax.description = [#bf92f9]Assault and support.[] Often used in attack and fire support because of their built-in rocket launcher on the upper body.
unit.atrax.details = [accent]Description:[] [#bf92f9]Atraxes[] are armed with two prototype flamethrowers capable of spewing spheres of slag, which, upon contact with the target, spill on the spot and set it on fire. They are also equipped with small rocket launchers, which compensates for their combat power in front of enemy defenses. In addition to all these features, they are able to cross over most of the terrain, which can be strategically used wisely.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Flamethrowers [#bf92f9]Atrax[] cannot be shot through the mountainous landscape, however, this does not apply to the rocket launcher on the upper part of their body. It is also important to know that missiles [#bf92f9]Atrax[] are electric and can very quickly destroy simple unpretentious opponents with a shooting range below themselves.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#bf92f9]Atraxes[] specialize in area damage due to their electrically charged missiles, besides, they are the only ones of their kind who are able to wander around other people's buildings so easily - it is recommended to find a way to counteract to prevent unscheduled penetration into the base. For the first time [lightgray]Arcs[] with [lightgray]Scorches[].

unit.spiroct.description = [#bf92f9]Assault and support.[] Improved in many aspects [#bf92f9]Atraxes[]. They cope well with the enemy's combat detachments. Not the best option for storming enemy bases.
unit.spiroct.details = [accent]Description:[] [#bf92f9]Spirocts[], as well as [#bf92f9]Atraxes[], can step over most of the terrain, which gives them some scope in combat tactics. Just like [#bf92f9]Atrax[], armed with a rocket launcher, but for the sake of its power, it had to cut its accuracy.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] They can shoot at air units and restore their health when attacked with laser beams that suck out the health of their enemy.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] Extremely dangerous in groups, because they are easily able to destroy units even with a shooting range above them.

unit.toxopid.description = [#bf92f9]Assault and support.[] Used in attacks when destroying heavily fortified enemy defenses. Good at destroying enemy ground targets, but weak in front of air targets.
unit.toxopid.details = [accent]Description:[] Massive and bulky [#bf92f9]Toxopids[] pose quite a big threat to bases where most of the defensive structures are concentrated at one point, because one shot from the main gun [#bf92f9]Toxopid[] is able to completely demolish all the enemy's defenses, and completely finish off the remaining ones with its laser guns. Also, do not forget that they are equipped with a rapid-firing cannon and 4 rocket launchers on the sides. They have strong screen arc shields on the sides and can step over most of the terrain, as well as other units with a down tier.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Based on its larger size, it is able to move partially over deep surfaces, while other parts of the legs should at this time be on a higher elevation, such as shallow water — for example, in order not to drown. They can also, as well as [#bf92f9]Arkids[], crush buildings with their feet.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#bf92f9]Toxopids[] are inferior in strength to quite a few combat units, but this is not a reason to be biased against them, because they are the most powerful units when it comes to area damage - no existing weapon, except for the [lightgray]Foreshadow[] themselves, is not able to restrain this type of units if they they will want to destroy the base in the immediate distance from it.

# Air assault units
unit.flare.description = [#ffa665]Assault, scouting and support.[] Usually needed for reconnaissance and quick attack, but they can be an excellent addition to the combat forces of an ally.
unit.flare.details = [accent]Description:[] Fast, high-speed and maneuverable fighters armed with a small-caliber machine gun to eliminate small strategically important enemy targets.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Most often, power supply lines are attacked, where at least a little, but there is energy.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] Very dangerous in large groups, especially if they are initially aimed at destroying your core.

unit.horizon.details = [accent]Description:[] [#ffa665]Horizons[] drop charges from three incendiary bombs, and then repeat the same thing until they die or destroy their target.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] [#ffa665]Horizons[] they pose the greatest danger to factories or factories, because their main priority is the destruction of the enemy's production infrastructure, and given that their shells are incendiary, they are a greater threat to an unprotected plant.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#ffa665]Horizons[] pose the same danger as the same [#ffa665]Flares[], because both have the same goal - to harm your production as much as possible, and then completely destroy the core in the shortest possible time.

unit.zenith.description = [#ffa665]Assault and support.[] Zeniths are mainly used to destroy enemy bases that are not heavily fortified, as well as to quickly eliminate small enemy detachments with carpet bombing or multiple rocket launchers.
unit.zenith.details = [accent]Description:[] [#ffa665]Zenith[] are universal air units for conducting combat operations both in the air and on the ground thanks to their rocket devices with a multiple launch system and portable bombs, but the special difference of [#ffa665]Zenith[] is that they are able to deploy their body body without the need for repeated calls, which makes them the best among most similar air units.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Launching pads with factories and storage facilities are often attacked in order to disrupt the logistics line for the supply of materials to a certain sector.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#ffa665]Zenith[] are a serious threat to bases with no air defense, because literally a couple of volleys from one or two rocket launchers are already enough to demolish most of the infrastructure of your base. - It is recommended to immediately apply precautions when detecting this enemy, if you are not going to tolerate a destroyer destroying your base to the very shreds.

unit.antumbra.description = [#ffa665]Assault and support.[] Often used to storm more inaccessible targets due to the ability to generate shields to nearby allies or in ambushes against heavy ground equipment that is not able to shoot through a high mountainous terrain.
unit.antumbra.details = [accent]Description:[] A heavy mobile attack aircraft armed with rapid-firing guns of the type «[#ffa665]Mammoth[]» and equipped with a pair of laser protective turrets against enemy flying projectiles, as well as two rocket launchers with anti-ground three-shot artillery guns to the advantage. Also in its arsenal there are small-caliber ultra-high-speed machine guns against air and ground targets. Among other things, they have a fairly technological built-in generator of an energy shield, both external and internal impacts.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] [#ffa665]Antumbra[] attack mainly repair towers and energy storage facilities, along with generators producing them, before attacking the enemy core.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#ffa665]Antumbra[] is a real problem for defenders, because they have strong enough shields through which a simple air defense system is not able to cause them any harm, so basically only more advanced towers can resist them, but their main annoying ability is to create strong shields for enemies, because so far they are alive, and those to whom these shields have been transferred are alive - it is recommended to get rid of them immediately so that they do not aggravate the situation of your affairs even worse than now.

unit.eclipse.description = [#ffa665]Assault and support.[] Heavy assault vessels are more often used in the assault of heavily defended enemy bases and the ability to generate sufficiently strong energy shields for allies, but are rarely used in the destruction of enemy army forces, because they are not always an effective means of fighting against them.
unit.eclipse.details = [accent]Description:[] The heavy assault ship of the class «[#ffa665]Dreadnought[]» has a shield of the type «[#ffa665]Hammerhead[]» and is armed with heavy laser guns that penetrates through any defense, and is also equipped with a heavy rapid-fire gun of the type «[#ffa665]Mammoth[]» together with small rapid-fire machine guns against air and ground targets, and in addition to this, improved laser point protection, inherited from ships [#ffa665]Antumbras[] and five-shot artillery guns, whose shells cause increased damage to buildings. Among other things, their arsenal is also complemented by a pair of homing rocket launchers: 4 against ground targets and 2 against air targets. Also inside [#ffa665]Eclipses[] the same energy shield generators are built in as in [#ffa665]Antumbras[], but 2 times better, however, efficiency had to be sacrificed, which is why recharging takes much longer than usual. It is also worth noting that the generator of external influence extends quite a long distance, which is why it is possible to issue shields to allied troops, being in the immediate distance from the enemy.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] [#ffa665]Eclipses[] in most cases attack defensive structures in order to facilitate the assault of their ground forces. However, in addition to defensive structures, [#ffa665]Eclipses[] are focused on [lightgray]COMPLETE [] destruction of the base, starting with factories and ending with production energy sources. — Eventually, when everything is destroyed, they will try to destroy your last hope - the core.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#ffa665]Eclipses[] are the main enemy, the embodiment of evil itself, of anyone fighting back. No matter how hard you try, no matter what things you overcome - all this will be destroyed by them, as if for them it is just child's play... — It is recommended to use a powerful and suitable weapon against heavily armored enemy aircraft if you are going to resist the will of your unfair fate.

unit.alpha.details = [accent]Description:[] [#ffa665]Alphas[] are armed with short-barreled, inaccurate machine guns firing bursts of 3 projectiles to hold the main defense against enemy forces, but more often they gather dust at her because they are rarely needed.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] [#ffa665]Alphas[] are rarely on the battlefields, but quite often the field commanders - their destruction will entail an early violation of the coordination of the enemy's combat forces, but only for a while.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] Destroying [#ffa665]Alphas[] does not completely destroy them until the main core or all cores are destroyed.

unit.beta.description = [#ffa665]Command and support.[] An improved version of the "[#ffa665]Alpha[]", capable of containing a small onslaught of the enemy, with the help of homing projectiles, and thanks to its better strength. Also [#ffa665]Betas[] is used in construction and command of troops.
unit.beta.details = [accent]Description:[] [#ffa665]Betas[] are armed with two small high-speed machine guns firing bursts of 3 homing projectiles, and also have a modification "[#ffa665]Petrel-1 []" for a laser beam, which allows them to mine slightly harder ore.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Rarely on the battlefields, but often command small detachments of troops to conduct combat operations - the destruction of these units will entail an early violation of the coordination of the enemy's combat forces, but only for a while.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] The enemy will be alive until the main core or cores are destroyed.

unit.gamma.description = [#ffa665]Command and support. Gammas[] is often used in construction and defense against small enemy air forces, because it is armed with special homing bullets and an internal energy shield to maintain greater survivability on the battlefield. The best choice for field commanders.
unit.gamma.details = [accent]Description:[] [#ffa665]Gamma[] is a combat version of the core units, armed with a rapid-fire machine gun firing bursts of 5 shells, as well as equipped with an internal impact shield generator.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Quite often enter the battlefields to conduct combat operations with the help of small or medium-sized detachments of troops - the destruction of these units will entail an early violation of the coordination of the enemy's combat forces, but only for a while.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] The enemy will respawn each time if the main core or cores are still not destroyed.
