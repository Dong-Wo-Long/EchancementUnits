But the main feature of the [#84f491]Corvus[] lies in their built-in module with nanites that can quickly repair non-critical damage to a unit on the battlefield, which allows these units not to need technical support from specialized units for some time.\n\n[salmon]Note:[] Laser turrets cannot shoot through mountainous terrain, nor are they capable of shooting at aerial targets - this also applies to laser cutters, however, like the main laser gun with a rocket launcher, it can shoot through any landscape terrain, except for defensive plastan walls.\n\n[red]⚠ Attention:[] [#84f491]Corvus[] extremely dangerous, so dangerous that they pose a global threat among most other units of their shooting range - therefore, if you do not have plastan walls, pray to God that your defense will not be destroyed with just one accurate shot.
